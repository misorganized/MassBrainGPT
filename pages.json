"A bombardier or bomb aimer is the crew member of a bomber aircraft responsible for the targeting of aerial bombs. \"Bomb aimer\" was the preferred term in the military forces of the Commonwealth, while \"bombardier\" (from the French word for \"bomb thrower\" and similar in meaning to \"grenadier\") was the equivalent position in the United States Armed Forces.\nIn many planes, the bombardier took control of the airplane during the bombing run, using a device such as the Norden bombsight which was connected to the autopilot of the plane. Often stationed in the extreme front of the aircraft, on the way to the target and after releasing the bombs, he could also serve as the front gunner in aircraft that had a front turret.\nIn the latter part of the 20th century, the title of bombardier fell into disuse, due largely to changes in technology, emanating from the replacement of this manual function with the development of computerized technology and smart bombs, that has given rise to terms like weapon systems officer or combat systems officer to describe the modern role."
